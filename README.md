# ROS2 Training with TurtleBot3

This repository contains my work and learning materials from the ROS2 training course, organized by ART-Central, Singapore, focused on using ROS2 with the TurtleBot3 robot.

## Course Content

During this training course, we covered fundamental topics in ROS2, including:

1. **ROS2 Node**: How to create and manage nodes in ROS2.
2. **ROS2 Topics**: Understanding the concept of publishers and subscribers, and using ROS2 topics to exchange data.
3. **ROS2 Services**: How to create and call services in ROS2.
4. **Launch Files**: Learning how to use launch files to start multiple nodes.
5. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Exploring QoS policies for reliable communication in ROS2.
6. **Executors**: Understanding executors and how to use them for multi-threading in ROS2.
7. **Multithreading**: Practical applications of multi-threading in ROS2 nodes.
8. **ROS2 Parameters**: How to manage and use parameters in ROS2 nodes.
9. **Practical Application with TurtleBot3**: Implementing the above concepts on a real TurtleBot3 model.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, I gained hands-on experience with ROS2 in a real-world robotics application. The training helped me understand the key features of ROS2 and how to implement them for robotic systems like the TurtleBot3.

## Repository Content

- Code examples of ROS2 nodes, topics, and services.
- Launch files and configurations used in the course.
- Practical applications on the TurtleBot3 robot using ROS2.
